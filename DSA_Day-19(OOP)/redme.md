# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++

Welcome to the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** section of the C++ repository. This folder contains concepts and examples based on the four core principles of OOP: **Abstraction**, **Encapsulation**, **Inheritance**, and **Polymorphism**.

## 💡 **Principles of OOP**

1. **Data Abstraction:** Hiding unnecessary details and showing only the required information using abstract classes and interfaces.
2. **Data Encapsulation:** Binding data and functions that manipulate data within a class to ensure data security.
3. **Inheritance:** Reusing code from parent classes using various types of inheritance.
4. **Polymorphism:** Performing a single task in multiple ways through method overloading, method overriding, and operator overloading.

## 🚀 **How to Use This Repository**

1. Start with the **Data Abstraction** folder to understand access modifiers and abstract concepts.
2. Move to **Data Encapsulation** to learn how constructors, destructors, and accessors work.
3. Practice different inheritance types in the **Inheritance** folder.
4. Master polymorphism concepts using the examples in the **Polymorphism** folder.
5. Test your understanding with the **Mini Projects** available in the **Projects** folder.
